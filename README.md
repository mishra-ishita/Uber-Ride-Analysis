# 🚖 Uber Ride Analysis (SQL | Python | Power BI | Excel)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes Uber ride data to uncover customer behavior, cancellations, ratings, and operational inefficiencies. Using SQL, Python, Power BI, and Excel, I performed data cleaning, EDA, visualization, and dashboarding to derive actionable business insights.


## 🎯 Problem Statement

Uber faces challenges like ride cancellations, incomplete rides, and low ratings,  which reduce efficiency and customer satisfaction.  
This project aims to analyze patterns and recommend solutions for better decision-making.


## 🔍 Objectives

-   Analyze ride trends (daily, monthly, hourly).
    
-   Identify  cancellation reasons by customers & drivers.
    
-   Compare VTAT vs CTAT to detect delays.
    
-   Evaluate customer & driver ratings.
    
-   Study payment methods & vehicle types preferences.
    
-   Build interactive dashboards for business decisions.
    

## 🗂 Dataset Description

The dataset includes ride booking details with the following columns:

-   Date, Time, Booking ID, Booking Status
    
-   Customer ID, Vehicle Type, Pickup & Drop Location
    
-   Avg VTAT, Avg CTAT, Cancellations (Customer/Driver)
    
-   Booking Value, Ride Distance, Ratings, Payment Method


## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

-   **SQL** → Trend & cancellation analysis
    
-   **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** → EDA & visualization
    
-   **Power BI** → Interactive dashboards
    
-   **Excel** → Quick analysis, pivot tables
    

## 📊 Analysis Performed

1.  **Data Cleaning:** handled nulls, duplicates, incorrect entries.
    
2.  **EDA:** ride trends, cancellation patterns, distance vs value, ratings analysis.
    
3.  **SQL Analysis:** top pickup/drop locations, completion % by booking status.
    
4.  **Python Analysis:** correlation between distance & ratings, cancellation heatmaps.
    
5.  **Power BI Dashboard:**
    
    -   ✅ Total Rides vs Completed/Cancelled/Incomplete
        
    -   ✅ Ratings distribution (customer vs driver)
        
    -   ✅ Top pickup & drop zones
        
    -   ✅ Payment methods & revenue contribution
        
6.  **Excel:** pivot tables for quick checks.
